    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gaming. I enjoy Role Play, Adventure, Action, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Sandbox, Strategy, Racing and Anime genres. I also indulge in streaming and socialising in and around games.</li>

I have a large variety of genres of story, setting and themes that I love to enjoy consuming.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LczGSoibRe8">Music</a>. My tastes in genres has definitely settled in the rock/metal genre of music, with variations of style, although, a main genre I enjoy the most is gothic, symphonic metal.</li>
      <li>Drawing. Even though I do illustrate and graphic designs for work, I also enjoy drawing what ever I want, like characters, all kinds of creatures, clothing designs and environments.</li>
